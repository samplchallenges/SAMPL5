# SAMPL5
Archived input files from the SAMPL5 challenge

## Challenge overview
SAMPL5 was organized by David L. Mobley and collaborators.

The SAMPL5 evaluation was carried out from October 2015 to February 2016, and discussed at a workshop held at UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA in March, 2016.

The participants were required to predict **distribution coefficients** and **host-guest interaction** (the prediction of **protein-ligand binding** challenge was part of the [D3R Grand Challenge 1](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge-2015)).

## SAMPL5 special issues
The papers covering the results of the challenge were published in two special issues of Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design, one dedicated to [distribution coefficients](https://link.springer.com/journal/10822/volumes-and-issues/30-11) and the second to [host-guest affinity](https://link.springer.com/journal/10822/volumes-and-issues/31-1).
